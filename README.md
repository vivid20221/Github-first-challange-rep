# Boot camp first challenge

## HTML structure
As a web developer I want to be able to organize my code so my team will be able to move through it with ease.

This project was to show me how to structure my HTML code and being able to deply it to git hub with the git command in the terminal.

Heres a link to learning how to set up your ssh keys to git hub and creating a new repository
